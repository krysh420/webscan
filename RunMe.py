                        'Solution for your cybersecurity needs'

-> This the home page which will guide you towards your smooth experience. \n
-> You need to go through the basic setup and you're good from there. \n

-> As for dependencies, mainly you will require NodeJS, Python, Docker/Podman installed. The rest is managed by us.

                A. STAGE ONE (Basic Setup)

-> We would like to get the port from you, on which the Django Server shall listen.
-> For changing the port of react, you can go to vite.config.js file and change the value of "port" there.


                B. STAGE TWO (Getting Started)
-> Now you will be introduced to our app and from there you can decide what to do as you wish
-> NOTE: If you are running the GUI App, make sure to run the react app in browser. All you need to do is copy and hit the url of app, which looks like=> http://localhost:<port>.
